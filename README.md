# Java-Web-Service-for-Blog
We are going to build a java web blog application based on restful structure. Our blog application will implement basic functions such like login, enrol, post an acticle and comment with other's contents. We already have a remoted server, and we will build related web service with Spring MVC structure. We try our effort to do the best.
