# Java-Web-Service-for-Blog
Back-End Introduction (Blog43)
Run this with intellj idea 
We are going to build a java web blog application based on restful structure. Our blog application will implement basic functions such like login, enrol, post an acticle and comment with other's contents. We already have a remoted server, and we will build related web service with Spring MVC structure. We try our effort to do the best.


Spring MVC + Hibernate + bootstrap + Mysql + Maven 

 Maven is a tool could import jars by increasings dependency tags on pom.xml
 
 Hibernate is an open source object-relational mapping framwork that could encapsulates JDBC with very lighweight
 object and maps POJO to database tables
 
 If you wanna run this ï¼Œyou should change your mysql settings in the  src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml
 Modifey the database name and password with your mysql settings.
 You should make sure two tables (user, Blog) in your database.
 
 mysql querys :
 
 CREATE TABLE `user` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `nickname` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  `first_name` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  `last_name` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) 

CREATE TABLE `Blog` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `title` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  `content` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  `user_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `pub_date` date NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
